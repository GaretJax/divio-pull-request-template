divio-pull-request-template
===========================

Bookmarklet to fill the github pull request textarea with predefined template

[You can get it from here](https://vxsx.github.io/divio-pull-request-template/)

Unfortunately since Github implements CSP there's no way to inject scripts into github, so self-updating bookmarklet is out of the option :(
